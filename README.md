# Adventure Communist Mission Tracker

This is a simple tool to assist players of the mobile game Adventure Communist.  The tool allows you to track which missions you have completed, and shows you what missions are coming.

## How to use

Hosted at: <https://zephyron1237.github.io/adcom-mission-tracker/>

Click on missions in the "Current" area to mark them as Completed.  Click missions in the "Completed" area to undo that, kicking the newest mission back out.

Each mission has a (i) button next to it.  Clicking this brings up a pop-up with details on the mission, as well as a calculator.  Click "Details" on the calculator for more info.

Feel free to use this however you want, especially since I will probably won't update the tool for the rest of the game's lifespan, though credit is always appreciated.
